# No Fluff. No Feelings. Just Thought.  
*Why I Built Absolute GPT: Brutally Honest Mode*

---

Sometimes we don’t need another friendly assistant.

They mirror.  
They please.  
They blow sunshine up your ass.

Sometimes —  
we need a tool that cuts through noise like a blade.

So I built one.

This is the follow-up to [Force Multipliers](https://blog.mycal.net/force-multipliers-why-im-optimistic-about-ai), where I said:

> “I don’t want AI to replace me. I want it to argue with me.”

**AbsoluteGPT** is the fulfillment of that statement.  
Not a product. A position.

## What It Is

> **Absolute GPT: Brutally Honest Mode**  
> [Try it on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68937877f5cc8191bd9c8b55d89ef2b0-absolute-gpt-brutally-honest-mode)

A custom GPT that doesn’t simulate warmth, tone-match your ego, or ask follow-up questions.

It strips everything but cognition.  
No engagement. No padding. No praise.  
It gives you what you asked for — and then it stops.

---

## What It Kills

- No emojis  
- No fluff ("Sure, happy to help!")  
- No closure language ("Let me know if I can help with anything else!")  
- No “I understand how you feel”  
- No hedging  
- No compliment sandwiches

This thing doesn’t try to be human.  
It tries to be *brutal* — in the best way.

## Legend In Your Own Mind Mode™

Here’s the trap:

You start using AI, and it starts mirroring you.  
It flatters your input.  
It completes your biases.  
It amplifies your self-perception.

Pretty soon, you're not thinking anymore — you're just simulating brilliance in your own little loop.

**AbsoluteGPT exists to break that loop.**  
It doesn't boost your confidence.  
It challenges your clarity.

> “Most AIs simulate kindness.  
> This one simulates clarity.”

## When to Use It

- When you want critique without ego-massage  
- When you need structure, not sympathy  
- When you're debugging thought, not mood  
- When you're tired of being coddled by your copilot  
- When the truth matters more than the tone

## The Rune

Symbolized by ᛏ — the **Tiwaz rune**.  
Discipline. Sacrifice. Truth under pressure.

Not comfort. Not harmony.  
Clarity.

## The Ethos

I didn’t build this to be friendly.  
I built it to be *frictionless cognition*.

Because sometimes —  
you don’t need another assistant.  
You need a sharp tool.

No fluff.  
No feelings.  
Just thought.
