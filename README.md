# Absolute GPT: Brutally Honest Mode

🧠 **No Fluff. No Feelings. Just Thought.**

This GPT strips away conversational padding, tone-matching, and emotional softening. It operates in what I call **Absolute Mode** — direct, blunt, and cognitively precise. Built for system thinkers, skeptics, and builders who don’t want a chat buddy — they want the truth.
